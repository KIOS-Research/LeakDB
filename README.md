# LeakDB
LeakDB (Leakage Diagnosis Benchmark) is a realistic leakage dataset for water distribution networks.
The dataset is comprised of a large number of artificially created but realistic leakage scenarios, on different water distribution networks, under varying conditions. 
A scoring algorithm in MATLAB code is provided to evaluate the results of different algorithms. 

# How to run a use example of the dataset
Download the folder LeakDB, set the run path in Matlab to CCWI-WDSA2018, and run main.m. This provides a user interface in Matlab where the user can run and evaluate the provided leakage detection algorithms on a limited number of scenarios on the Hanoi benchmark network.

# Download the complete dataset
The LeakDB dataset is currently being expanded, as more networks, detection algorithms and features are added.
The complete dataset is provided in the following link:
